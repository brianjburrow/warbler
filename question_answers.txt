STEP TWO:

STEP SEVEN:

The logged in user id is being tracked through flask sessions.

Flasks g object is instantiated every time a request is made, and is available during the request, but not after the request completes.

add_user_to_g is an easy way to query for the current user who's id is stored in the flask session.  It gives us access
to g.user during the request (and in the associated jinga template).

@app.before_request is executed everytime a route is accessed.
